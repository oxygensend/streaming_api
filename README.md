Main aim of this project is that I wanted to test how video streaming works and to develop my node.js/typescript skills. Project is written with OPP principles in typescript.

In first data is sent in chunks from files saved on local disk, in the second data is sent with S3 stream, and in last example signed url is used that get the S3 object.
